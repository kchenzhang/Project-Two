        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        I am a current student at Illinois Institute of Technology that is
        expected to graduate in Spring 2021, I have experiences in professional
        development leadership activities and in the customer service industry
        for several years. I am aspiring to a career that can develop my
        potential growth opportunities and looking forward to being part of a
        team that builds strong communication and technical skills as a
        foundation to support the company's brand and goals. In my free time, I
        like to enjoy music, watch movies and shows, and read books. I find it
        really relaxing to have some time to reflex with myself and discover
        interesting things that can motivate me in my life.
